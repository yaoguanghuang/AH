            <p>The Adventurer is a cruise ship aiming to provide a safe and comfortable trip. You, as our respectful Captain, are responsible for taking care of 3 adventurers like you always do—Even with these 3 troublemakers to varying degrees, we trust you to try your best to make sure they are full and alive when they off-board. </p>

            <h2>Motive</h2>
            <p>Despite our society stopping ignoring mental health, most social institutes—such as campuses and communities—treat patients with psychological disorders as troubles and burdens. Instead of providing actual help, what is usually being implied is the strategy only to prevent them from self-injured or suicide at any cost, specifically and only under their supervision. This non-human-oriented attitude only brings fear of expressing or over-supervising without privacy. In The Adventurer, the player will serve as a supervisor who tries to keep 3 NPCs with different psychological disorders able-bodied and alive. Through experience and involvement in executing the supervision, I hope players could eventually understand how this system is broken, and how much unequal power the supervisor has over patients in need.</p>

            <p>As the Captain of The Adventurer, the player’s daily agenda includes distributing food to passengers, prescribing them medications, making important decisions for them, and of course, checking in with them daily to always supervise their conditions to prevent them from self-injured or suicide. The standard game flow is listed below:</p>
