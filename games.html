        <h1>Game</h1>

        <div class="Contents">
            
            <p>I have been an active video gamer/video game content audience since I was a child, and I have actively engaged in Game Design since Dec. 2023. I have over one year of experience with Game development in Unity(C#), as well as creating 2D Game Art assets in both pixel and non-pixel. I am also exploring technique rendering for future or existing games of mine in various areas, like sound, texture, and lighting. However, the most valuable part of the whole production is always Game Design. </p>
            <p>As an independent Game Designer, I enjoy the process of developing genres and concepts and eventually developing them into playable mechanics and prototypes. The process of building scenes is like world-building, at least fragmented world-building for me. Engines provide me an infinite space to use for art creation and design expression: this is the fundamental reason for my being a game designer.</p>
            <p>I have been familiar with developing and designing in different game genres, especially in simulators and Action & Adventure of any kind, which are also regulars on my Steam shelf. However, I consider the most important trait of Game Design to be narrating and experience: what story the game is trying to tell what emotion the player could gain from the gameplay, and if that emotion serves as a special experience. I especially focus on collaborating the mechanics and story-telling in designing, every element of development serves as the refinement to the narrating and player experience. </p>
            <p>Despite the genre as entertainment, I consider games could be serious media that contain, carry, and spread certain information. I usually incorporate social issues that I care about or personal narratives into my game design. The game itself can entertain the public, while also causing the audience to think or experience different parts of the world and life at the same time.</p>
            <p>
            Anyway, please enjoy this Arcade Gallery! I hope any of my players can gain the same amount of pleasure just like the moment I am creating them. 
            </p>
