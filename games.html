            <h1>GAME</h1>
            <p>I have been an active video gamer/video game content audience since I was a child, and I have actively engaged in Game Design since Dec. 2023. I have over one year of experience with Game development in Unity(C#), as well as creating 2D Game Art assets in both pixel and non-pixel. I am also exploring technique rendering for future or existing games of mine in various areas, like sound, texture, and lighting. However, the most valuable part of the whole production is always Game Design. </p>
            <p>As an independent Game Designer, I enjoy the process of developing genres and concepts and eventually developing them into playable mechanics and prototypes. The process of building scenes is like world-building, at least fragmented world-building for me. Engines provide me an infinite space to use for art creation and design expression: this is the fundamental reason for my being a game designer.</p>
            <p>I have been familiar with develop and design in different game genre, especially in simulartors and Action & Adventure of any kind, which are also regulars on my steam shelf too. </p>
            <p>Updates to be expected (Last Updates 3/16/2025).</p>

                    Infinite is an Action & Adventure Game that contains three levels. In each level, the player will control the main character to fly across the map, trying to pass multiple traps, collect as many rewards as possible, and finally reach the end of each scene. The Game Protagonist is a clawless sparrow,  who is designed to spend its whole life relentlessly flying, until reaching the end on the other side. While the player follows it to go through and finish the game, this game will show the three different phases of the life of this clawless sparrow, and try to reveal the reason for its relentless flying journey in the “Infinite” sky.

                        As a frequent international flyer, I find the time experience of long-distance flying special: due to both the extended duration of long-distance travel and the time zone changes, travelers can experience the drastic passing of time without actually “losing” it, which feels like the flight itself is chasing the daylight for you—the only commute that “doesn’t” cost you time. Flying Towards the Daylight is a long-distance flight simulator capturing this specialty. The player will be a flight catcher going through four stages of a long-distance flight, experiencing the combined sense of urgency, duration, and loneliness of daylight chasing.

                    CabHouse is a pet simulator: it is a fish tank that carries both glowing jellyfish in different colors and a Cab, who is a little aquatic creature with both features of crab and cat. The Cab is the Top Predator of this ecosystem, which allows her to eat as many glowing jellyfish as she wants. However, she is also so cautious that she only dares to leave the bottom of the tank unless you turn the light off.  With the control of the light switch and the constant monitor of the Cab, you can manipulate this fish tank and the condition of these little creatures in your preferred way.

                    The Adventurer is a commercial cruise ship aiming to provide a comfortable trip that allows our passengers to arrive at their destination safely. You, as our respectful Captain, are responsible for taking care of passengers like you always do—Even with these 3 adventurers troublemakers to varying degrees, we trust you to try your best to make sure they will be still full and alive when they get off your ship in 3 days.
